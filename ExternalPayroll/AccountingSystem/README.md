# ExternalPayroll/AccountingSystem Stub

This is a **scaffold and integration stub** for an optional External Payroll or Accounting System, designed to integrate with the Employee Management System Monolith.

## Purpose

This module provides a stub/interface for integrating third-party payroll/accounting systems with the core application, supporting interoperability and potential data exchange.

---

## Expected Integration Approach

- Integration via **RESTful APIs** and/or **Webhook callbacks**
- Monolith backend (`EmployeeManagementSystemMonolith`) acts as the client (initiator) for payroll data submission, sync, or query.
- This container may act as:
  - An **API endpoint** that receives payroll/batch requests from Monolith
  - A **webhook receiver** for real-time notifications
  - Or provides an **API client stub** for outbound calls to an external system

### Interaction Points

**1. Outbound API Integration (from Monolith):**
- `POST /payroll/batch`: Submit payroll batch for processing.
- `GET /accounting/ledger/{period}`: Query accounting data for reconciliation.

**2. Inbound Webhooks:**
- `POST /webhook/payroll-status`: Receives status updates from the external payroll system (stubbed here).

**3. Authentication**
- Stubs do not implement authentication. For real integration, expect token-based (Bearer/JWT) or API key authentication.

---

## Included Files

- `integration_client_stub.py`: Python stub/client for interaction from Monolith backend (can be replaced or extended).
- `mock_external_api.py`: Simple mock API endpoint for demo/testing, providing dummy responses (optional for development).

---

## Usage

- Use `integration_client_stub.py` in development or for contract/testing of API boundaries.
- Run `mock_external_api.py` to simulate external system for demo/test.

> All components in this directory are **STUBS** for integration reference only. Extend/replace with real logic before production.
